# gnomwav

This directory contains the R package *gnomwav*. The package provides functions to perform wavelet variance and correlation decompositions of genomic signals, averaging across chromosomes (or more generally any set of multiple temporal or spatial signals). The methods are described in our manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.25.542345v1.

# Installation

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jgroh/gnomwav")
```

Function documentation can be found in the usual way within R, e.g. `?gnom_var_decomp`. I'm working on expanding this page to be more useful, questions/suggestions are welcome. jgroh at ucdavis dot edu
